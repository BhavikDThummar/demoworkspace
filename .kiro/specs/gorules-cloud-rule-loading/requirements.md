# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends the existing GoRules integration to implement dynamic rule loading from the GoRules Cloud API. Currently, the GoRules library has placeholder implementations for rule loading that need to be replaced with actual HTTP API calls to fetch rules from one or multiple GoRules Cloud projects. This will enable the Zen Engine to execute rules that are dynamically loaded from the cloud rather than requiring local rule files.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to load rules dynamically from the GoRules Cloud API, so that I can execute business rules without needing to store rule files locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a rule is requested for execution THEN the system SHALL fetch the rule from the GoRules Cloud API using the rule ID
2. WHEN the rule is successfully fetched THEN it SHALL be loaded into the Zen Engine for execution
3. IF the rule fetch fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the failure reason
4. WHEN the same rule is requested multiple times THEN the system SHALL implement caching to avoid unnecessary API calls

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure multiple GoRules projects, so that I can load rules from different projects based on my application needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple projects are configured THEN the system SHALL support loading rules from any configured project
2. WHEN a rule ID is provided THEN the system SHALL determine which project contains the rule
3. IF a rule exists in multiple projects THEN the system SHALL use a configurable priority order to determine which project to use
4. WHEN project configuration changes THEN the system SHALL update the available rule sources without requiring application restart

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want efficient rule caching and management, so that my application performs well and doesn't make excessive API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a rule is loaded THEN it SHALL be cached in memory for subsequent executions
2. WHEN cached rules expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh them from the API
3. IF memory usage becomes high THEN the system SHALL implement LRU eviction to manage cache size
4. WHEN rule versions change in the cloud THEN the system SHALL detect and update cached rules appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling for rule loading failures, so that my application can gracefully handle network issues and API errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
2. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL respect rate limiting and queue requests appropriately
3. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and attempt to re-authenticate
4. WHEN rule loading fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to cached versions if available

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate rule availability and metadata, so that I can ensure rules exist before attempting execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rule validation is requested THEN the system SHALL check rule existence via API calls
2. WHEN rule metadata is requested THEN the system SHALL fetch and return comprehensive rule information
3. IF a rule doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL return clear validation results indicating the missing rule
4. WHEN rule dependencies exist THEN the system SHALL validate and load dependent rules automatically

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want monitoring and observability for rule loading operations, so that I can track performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rules are loaded THEN the system SHALL log loading times and success/failure rates
2. WHEN cache operations occur THEN the system SHALL track cache hit/miss ratios and performance metrics
3. IF loading performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide metrics to identify bottlenecks
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide detailed trace information for rule loading operations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure and authenticated access to the GoRules Cloud API, so that my rule loading operations are properly authorized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL include proper authentication headers
2. WHEN authentication tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh them
3. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL handle 401/403 errors gracefully
4. WHEN API keys are rotated THEN the system SHALL support seamless key updates without downtime
