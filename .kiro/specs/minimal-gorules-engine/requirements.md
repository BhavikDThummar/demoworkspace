# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a minimal, high-performance GoRules engine optimized for low latency and high throughput. Unlike the existing comprehensive GoRules integration, this engine strips away all non-essential overhead including circuit breakers, heavy logging, monitoring, resilience layers, and rate-limiting. The focus is on core functionality: loading and caching rules from GoRules Cloud, flexible rule selection, and efficient execution modes with minimal runtime footprint.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to load and cache rules from GoRules Cloud with minimal overhead, so that I can achieve maximum performance in rule execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the engine starts THEN it SHALL fetch all decision JSON files from the configured GoRules Cloud project
2. WHEN rules are fetched THEN they SHALL be stored in an efficient in-memory cache with minimal memory footprint
3. WHEN a rule version mismatch is detected THEN the cache SHALL automatically update with the newer rule version
4. WHEN rules are cached THEN the system SHALL avoid unnecessary allocations and blocking operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible rule selection by ID or tags, so that I can execute individual rules or groups of rules efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a rule ID is provided THEN the system SHALL fetch and execute the specific rule
2. WHEN rule tags are provided THEN the system SHALL execute all rules matching those tags
3. WHEN multiple rule IDs are provided THEN the system SHALL execute all specified rules
4. WHEN a rule has multiple tags THEN it SHALL be selectable by any of its tags

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want parallel and sequential execution modes based on function inputs, so that I can optimize rule execution based on dependencies and performance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN execution function specifies parallel mode THEN the system SHALL execute independent rules concurrently for maximum throughput
2. WHEN execution function specifies sequential mode THEN the system SHALL execute rules in ordered pipeline based on input parameters
3. WHEN execution function specifies mixed mode THEN the system SHALL allow parallel groups where each group runs sequentially internally based on input configuration
4. WHEN execution modes are determined by function inputs THEN the system SHALL maintain thread safety without performance penalties

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want low-latency, minimal overhead execution, so that I can achieve maximum performance in high-throughput scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rules are executed THEN the system SHALL minimize memory allocations during runtime
2. WHEN concurrent execution occurs THEN the system SHALL avoid blocking operations where possible
3. WHEN the engine operates THEN it SHALL maintain a lightweight cache with no heavy telemetry
4. WHEN performance is measured THEN the system SHALL demonstrate measurably lower latency than feature-rich alternatives

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want extensible and maintainable code architecture, so that I can easily read, modify, and test the engine.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the code is structured THEN it SHALL use clear modules with single responsibilities
2. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN the system SHALL use dependency injection for testability
3. WHEN modifications are needed THEN the architecture SHALL support easy extension without core changes
4. WHEN testing is performed THEN all components SHALL be easily mockable and testable

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want concurrency-safe operations, so that I can use the engine in multi-threaded environments without data races.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN concurrent access occurs THEN the system SHALL protect shared state with appropriate synchronization
2. WHEN cache updates happen THEN they SHALL be atomic and thread-safe
3. WHEN multiple goroutines execute rules THEN there SHALL be no data races or corruption
4. WHEN global state is necessary THEN it SHALL be properly guarded with minimal locking overhead

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want cross-platform compatibility for both server-side and client-side usage, so that I can use the same engine in NestJS backend and React frontend with flexible deployment options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the engine is used in NestJS THEN it SHALL provide proper module integration and dependency injection support
2. WHEN the engine is used in React THEN it SHALL support multiple deployment options: direct client-side execution OR API-based rule loading from NestJS backend
3. WHEN API-based approach is used THEN the React client SHALL load rules via API calls to the NestJS backend running the minimal engine
4. WHEN direct client-side execution is used THEN the engine SHALL work in browser environments with consistent behavior to server-side execution

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear API signatures and usage examples, so that I can integrate the engine quickly and correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API documentation is provided THEN it SHALL include clear method signatures and parameters
2. WHEN usage examples are given THEN they SHALL demonstrate rule loading, caching, and mixed execution scenarios
3. WHEN performance guidance is provided THEN it SHALL include benchmarking instructions and latency verification
4. WHEN integration is needed THEN examples SHALL show real GoRules Cloud integration with sample inputs
