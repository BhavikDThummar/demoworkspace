# ✅ HTTPS Configuration - Successfully Implemented

Your NestJS application now supports both HTTP and HTTPS modes based on environment configuration.

## 🎉 What's Working

- ✅ Valid SSL certificates generated and included in build
- ✅ Environment-based HTTPS toggle
- ✅ Automatic certificate path detection
- ✅ Graceful fallback to HTTP if certificates fail
- ✅ Certificates properly bundled in production builds

## 🔧 Usage

### Enable HTTPS

```bash
# In your .env file
ENABLE_HTTPS=true
```

### Disable HTTPS (HTTP only)

```bash
# In your .env file
ENABLE_HTTPS=false
```

## 📁 Certificate Locations

- **Development**: `src/assets/certs/`
- **Production Build**: `dist/assets/certs/`
- **Certificates**: `key.pem` and `cert.pem`

## 🚀 Running the Application

### Development Mode

```bash
npx nx serve bomdemoapiv2
```

### Production Build

```bash
npx nx build bomdemoapiv2
node apps/bomdemoapiv2/dist/main.js
```

## 🔒 Certificate Details

- **Type**: Self-signed (for development)
- **Valid for**: localhost, 127.0.0.1
- **Algorithm**: RSA 2048-bit
- **Validity**: 1 year
- **Format**: PEM encoded

## 🌐 Access URLs

- **HTTP**: `http://localhost:8001/api`
- **HTTPS**: `https://localhost:8001/api`

## ⚠️ Browser Security Warning

Since these are self-signed certificates, browsers will show a security warning. This is normal for development. Click "Advanced" → "Proceed to localhost" to continue.

## 🔄 For Production

Replace the development certificates in `src/assets/certs/` with proper SSL certificates from a certificate authority before deploying to production.

## 🎯 Test Results

✅ Certificate generation: SUCCESS  
✅ Certificate validation: SUCCESS  
✅ HTTPS server creation: SUCCESS  
✅ Build integration: SUCCESS  
✅ Path resolution: SUCCESS
