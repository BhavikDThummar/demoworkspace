# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves integrating GoRules business rules engine into the existing Nx workspace. The integration will include creating a reusable Nx library for GoRules functionality that can be shared across multiple applications within the workspace. The implementation will provide a clean abstraction layer for executing business rules, managing rule configurations, and handling rule execution results within NestJS applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a reusable GoRules library within the Nx workspace, so that I can share GoRules functionality across multiple applications without code duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GoRules library is created THEN it SHALL be generated as an Nx library with proper project configuration
2. WHEN the library is built THEN it SHALL compile successfully and be importable by other workspace projects
3. WHEN the library is published internally THEN it SHALL be available for consumption by applications in the workspace
4. IF the library needs to be updated THEN applications SHALL be able to consume the latest version through standard Nx dependency management

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure GoRules SDK with proper authentication and connection settings, so that the application can communicate with the GoRules service securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GoRules SDK is initialized THEN it SHALL use environment-based configuration for API keys and endpoints
2. WHEN authentication credentials are provided THEN the SDK SHALL establish a secure connection to the GoRules service
3. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback handling
4. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN it SHALL validate required parameters and throw descriptive errors for missing values

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute business rules through a clean service interface, so that I can integrate rule execution into my application logic without tight coupling to the GoRules SDK.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a rule execution is requested THEN the service SHALL accept rule ID and input data as parameters
2. WHEN rule execution completes successfully THEN the service SHALL return structured results with decision outcomes
3. IF rule execution fails THEN the service SHALL handle errors gracefully and return meaningful error information
4. WHEN multiple rules need to be executed THEN the service SHALL support batch execution capabilities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate the GoRules library into my NestJS application, so that I can use dependency injection and follow NestJS architectural patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GoRules library is integrated THEN it SHALL provide NestJS modules for dependency injection
2. WHEN services are injected THEN they SHALL be available throughout the application using standard NestJS patterns
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the GoRules module SHALL initialize properly with configuration
4. IF module initialization fails THEN the application SHALL provide clear startup error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and examples, so that I can understand how to use the GoRules integration effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is created THEN it SHALL include step-by-step setup instructions
2. WHEN examples are provided THEN they SHALL demonstrate common use cases and integration patterns
3. WHEN API documentation is generated THEN it SHALL include all public interfaces and their usage
4. IF developers need troubleshooting help THEN documentation SHALL include common issues and solutions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can debug issues and monitor rule execution in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur during rule execution THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate detail levels
2. WHEN rule execution succeeds THEN success metrics SHALL be logged for monitoring
3. IF network issues occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN detailed execution traces SHALL be available in development mode

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want type safety and IntelliSense support, so that I can develop with confidence and catch errors at compile time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript interfaces are defined THEN they SHALL cover all GoRules API interactions
2. WHEN developers use the library THEN they SHALL receive full IntelliSense support in their IDE
3. WHEN type mismatches occur THEN they SHALL be caught at compile time rather than runtime
4. IF API responses change THEN type definitions SHALL be updated to maintain type safety
